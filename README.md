This file contains the code of Team 4159's 2023 IRC (Internal Robotics Competition) first place winners.
The robot had tank drive with two CIM's on the left and right and was controlled by 2 joysticks. 
The subsystem was a pivoting arm (ran by a CIM), and a compression wheel intake (ran by a bag motor). 
The code was writen by Yu-Faye Yang and Kalani Davis with help from older mentors. 
From Team Black (SuperNova) and their robot, SR-71 Blackbird!
