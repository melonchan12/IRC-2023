This file contains the code of Team 4159's 2023 IRC (Internal Robotics Competition) first-place winners.
The robot had a tank drive with two CIMs on the left and right and was controlled by 2 joysticks. 
The subsystem was a pivoting arm (run by a CIM), and a compression wheel intake (run by a bag motor). 
It also contains an autonomous drive. 
The code was written by Yu-Faye Yang and Kalani Davis with help from older mentors. 
From Team Black (SuperNova) and their robot, SR-71 Blackbird! 
Unfortunately, due to changes made to the code during the competition (and possibly not saved), this might not be the finalized code.
